### 👋 Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Developer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

## Threads Clone

This project is a clone of Threads app. I combined SwiftUI for the user interface, Firebase for backend functionalities, and Kingfisher for image loading and caching.

This Threads Clone project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Threads or any associated entities. It is created for educational purposes and as a demonstration of SwiftUI and Firebase integration.

##### 🔨 Technologies: SwiftUI, MVVM, Firebase, Kingfisher Push Notifications, .
##### 🚀 Platform: 📱iOS.
